# 🪟Windows SortFile Script using Python🐍
Personal project created using python to automatic sort files from *Downloads folder* in Windows OS
* Create folders by the file's extension
* Move files by the extension from each one

## 📎Notes
* It's not overwrite files yet
* It's running a little bit slowly
* It may crash at some point for some magical reason (or a logical reason)
